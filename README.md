# National-Park-Weather

## Description
This website was designed to provide National Parks and weather information based on a state input by the user. Upon searching for any given state, the user is presented with "park cards" displaying a photo of the park as well as a description. On the backend, additional semantic value is provided by an "alt tag" for the photos. The user will also be presented with a "weather card" displaying weather data for the associated park. A recent search history is populated after each search.

## Technology
We built our page using a simple HTML layout to begin. JavaScript was used for functionality using a combination of script and local storage components. The program pulls from two seperate APIs (National Parks Service & OpenWeather). We then styled everything using our own custom CSS file. There are some dynamic elements to the page such as a gif that displays when the weather card is hovered over.
